zfs-auto-snapshot:

An alternative implementation of the zfs-auto-snapshot service for Linux
and Macosx (currently tested and compatible with ZEVO Community Edition).

It can automatically create, rotate, and destroy periodic ZFS snapshots. This
is utility that creates the @zfs-auto-snap_frequent, @zfs-auto-snap_hourly,
@zfs-auto-snap_daily, @zfs-auto-snap_weekly, and @zfs-auto-snap_monthly
snapshots if it is installed.

It can backup (send) the snapshots to remote systems or external disks,
utilizing zfs send command. On darwin this can replace TimeMachine backups,
currently not running on top of ZFS filesystems.

This program is a posixly correct bourne shell script. It depends on zfs
utilities only (Linux). Unfortunatelly on Darwin it needs 'getopt' from 
macports or homebrew.

For using --send option, adapt opt_sendtocmd variable accordingly by editing the
script zfs-auto-snapshot.sh.

    sudo make OSTYPE=linux|darwin install
    
    installs cron / launchd startup scripts and copies script to /usr/sbin
directory.

    On darwin for daily, weekly and monthly stuff, anacron install is highly
recommended.
